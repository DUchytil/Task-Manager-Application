# Overview

This software is a simple task manager designed to make everyday tasks easy to track. However, this application goes beyond the normal task tracker requirements by adding additional parameters that might be useful in evaluating how to tackle your busy day. For example, this program allows you to record more than just the task name, but it also allows you to record the task importance, the task status, and a brief description of the task. All of these things help in making your minute-to-minute choices easier.

This software was written in the Kotlin programming language, which I took on as a challenge to further my software skills. Until now, this language had been foreign to me, so my intent in writing this software was to expand my basic umbrella of knowledge to other software development applications.
